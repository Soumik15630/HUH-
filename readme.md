*"Ig I’m doing something… but hell if I know what."*

## Project Vision 🚀  

The repo is literally called **HUH?** and the description is *“Ig I’m doing something.”*  
That should tell you everything: this is a full-blown midlife crisis, except there’s no life yet to be in the middle of.  

Here’s the deal:  
- I’m coding a **“SOMETHING”** that doesn’t exist.  
- Don’t know why. Don’t know how. Probably won’t know even after it’s done.  
- The end goal? *Will do something. Probably.*  

These "lines of code" will:  
- Do something.  
- Or absolutely nothing.  
- Honestly, 50/50.

## Architecture (aka: I drew boxes so it looks serious)  

**Repo Name:** HUH?  
**Description:** "Ig I’m doing something"  

Translation: I have no clue what’s happening, but diagrams make it look important.

## Current Status 🏁

Pieces you’ll probably never understand unless you’ve failed physics twice (don’t worry, me too):

- ✅ **Environment Engine** → Yay, we can simulate fog. Still no cars.
- ⚠️ **Car Physics** → Half-baked. Expect your “car” to yeet into orbit like a SpaceX launch.
- ❌ **Track Engine** → Still a hallucination.
- ❌ **RL Agent** → Currently just `import torch`. Future coping mechanism disguised as AI.

## Why? 

Because **“GOD TOLD ME TO.”**
